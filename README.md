# Stock Index Forecasting: S&P 500 and Dow 30 Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes and forecasts the performance of the **S&P 500** and **Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow 30)** over a 5-year period. The goal is to provide data-driven insights for investors, exploring trends, volatility, and potential correlations between these indices. Advanced models like **ARIMA** are used to forecast future movements and guide investment decisions.

## Key Objectives

1. **Analyze Historical Data**:
   - Compare annualized returns of the S&P 500 and Dow 30.
   - Evaluate moving averages (50-day, 200-day) for trend analysis.
   - Assess market volatility and investor risk profiles.
   - Identify correlations between the indices' movements.

2. **Forecast Index Prices**:
   - Use ARIMA time series models to predict future index values.
   - Evaluate model performance with RMSE and forecast accuracy.

3. **Provide Actionable Insights**:
   - Help investors understand trends for better decision-making.
   - Highlight key findings through data visualizations.
